<!-- Reflection
During this project i learned how to write a page on information 
about a certain topic. I learned how to write this through code 
and also how to style my paper through code. For example the image
that i put in was really cool i though and added a cool aspect to the 
page. Some things that i could have improved on though is maybe trying
to make each aspect more unique. Somee other things that i could learn 
is maybe how to make the letters move which could make the page really 
cool and add somethhing new to it.Something that i would want to learn
that could add something to the page is maybe a small video or 
buttons that could lead you to different parts of the page. -->
